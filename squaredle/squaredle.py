# This program solves a Squaredle puzzle. Go to squaredle.app to play.
# Here are the rules (also shown on the website):

# Squaredle is played on a 4x4 grid of letters.
# Find words by connecting letters up, down, left, right and diagonally. Longer words are worth more points!
# When your progress bar reaches the first star, letters on the board will show a number â€” how many words start with that square. Reach the star after that for another new trick!
# Squaredle, like Scrabble, doesn't accept capitalized or hyphenated words.

# This program uses all words longer than 4 letters in the Scrabble dictionary.

import numpy as np

# This function finds all possible words on a board and returns a list of them
# mat is a 2d array that holds all letters on the board
# visited is a set that holds tuples of all letters already used in a word
# i and j are the location of the current letter being added to the word
# curr_word is all the letters in the path checked so far
# words is a list of all Scrabble words
# results is a list of all valid words found so far
